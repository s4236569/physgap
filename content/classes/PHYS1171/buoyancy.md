# Buoyancy


$F_{buoy}=m_f g=\rho_f V_f g$

Take the block of water inside the bucket on the left hand side. This block of water is being upheld by the pressure in the liquid underneath the block of water, while being pressed down by the force of gravity.
Since this block of water is stationary, that means that the force of gravity equals the force of bouyancy. So at this point:
$F_{gravity}=F_{buoyant}=m_f g$

Now, regardless of the object that replaces this block of water, the pressure underneath the block doesn't change. So the buoyant force doesn't change, as long as the new object replaces the volume of the block of water.
So regardless of the object, the buoyant force is:

$$F_{buoy}=m_f g=\rho_f V_f g$$

Now the volume of the block of water is the volume of water that is displaced by the submerged object. The object replaced that volume of water. So now we have a way of measuring the bouyant force. We simply find the amount of water that is displaced when an object is submerged, found by the increase in volume of the container.
Now if the density of the object is less than the density of the water the object will float.

The bouyant force here is equal to the gravitational force acting on the the object, so the object floats. If the object is pushed down further the buoyant force overcomes the gravitational force and pushes the object to the surface.

If an object is more dense than the fluid then the object will sink to the bottom of the container.
